# Intro

This is a project by Noora Health. This has two main components: an intent-recognition system and an assistant platform for the medical support executives to provide health information to the patients/caregivers.

### What do we do?

RES is a mobile-based messaging service for patients and caregivers that empowers them towards healthy behaviors through in-time reminders and personalized support. RES is delivered through WhatsApp (scheduled messages, chatbot, and live chat), Voice (IVRS), or Teletrainers (live calls). We encourage patients and caregivers to ask us questions through these modalities and have a team of nurses and doctors to support this two-way communication platform.

### Key Features of RES
