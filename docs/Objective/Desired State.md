### Enhanced Intent Recognition:

Bypassing the MSE Inbox: Automatically filter out messages that are not medically relevant, ensuring they do not reach the Medical Support Executive's (MSE) inbox. These typically include:

- Greetings
- Acknowledgments
- Spam
- Requests to change language
- Medical Questions (Assigned)
- High Risk Intent (Assigned)
- Others (Assigned)

### Respond with an approved response for each of the classification.

Automated Medical Ticket Generation: Seamlessly create tickets for medical-related inquiries.

### MSE Assistant: Efficient Medical Query Resolution:

Rapid Response Mechanism: Ensure swift and effective resolution of user medical queries.

Accelerated Translation Process:Ensure prompt and accurate translations for both user queries and generated responses. (Achieved through language-based routing system, which assigns queries to Medical Support Executives (MSEs) who are proficient in the relevant languages, thereby guaranteeing a seamless and efficient communication flow.)

### Enhancing User Experience by Minimizing Waiting Times:

- To improve the efficiency and user satisfaction during periods of wait, implement a feature that automatically presents users with a curated list of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers relevant to their medical inquiries. 
- This proactive approach aims to provide immediate assistance and potentially resolve queries even before a response is received from the Medical Support Expert (MSE).If that answered their query, They can close the chat with a button if that answered their query.
