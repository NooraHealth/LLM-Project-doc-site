# Why Intent Recognition?

At Noora Health, we’ve answered more than 100K user questions with a dedicated team of medical professionals. With a core belief in having a ‘human in the loop’, we’ve set up processes to answer the vast amount of queries received through Freshdesk for ticketing, and TURN for responding to these users.

To ensure that only medical queries are handled by these support executives, we have developed rule-based systems on TURN to filter out a wide variety of general queries. However, we’re still facing challenges where the queries are wrongly-labelled owing to the vast variety of variations in the messages received. 

We aim to leverage generative-AI to auto-respond to generic messages that come under spam, greetings, acknowledgements etc. In this way, the MSEs could focus their time and energy on what they do best: to answer medical queries, with empathy.
