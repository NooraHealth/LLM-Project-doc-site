# Testing Procedures

### Protocols for Testers

- Engage a diverse group of testers, including those fluent in the system’s supported languages and individuals with healthcare knowledge,
to manually input queries and evaluate the system’s responses for accuracy, relevance, and usefulness.
- Testers should also assess the user interface’s usability, particularly the effectiveness and accessibility of the feedback
mechanisms. ### Protocols for Feedback Collection
- For each query response provided by the MSE Assistant, include a “thumbs up” (satisfied) or “thumbs down” (dissatisfied) option, allowing
users to quickly express their satisfaction level with the
response.
- Alongside the satisfaction indicator, provide an optional input field where users can elaborate on their feedback, offering insights
into what they found helpful or areas where the response fell short. This input field can capture valuable details on the user’s experience,
expectations, and specific issues encountered.

### Protocols for Iterative Improvement

### Analysis of Feedback

- Regularly analyze the feedback, categorizing it based on the type of query, the nature of the feedback (positive or negative), and any
specific suggestions or issues highlighted by users.
- Pay particular attention to repeated patterns of dissatisfaction or specific areas where users consistently request improvements.

### System Refinement

- Utilize the feedback to make targeted improvements to the MSE Assistant. This could involve enhancing the translation layer for better
accuracy, updating the medical FAQ bank to address gaps in information, or refining the response generation process for greater relevance and
clarity.
- Prioritize updates based on the frequency and severity of the feedback, ensuring that changes are likely to have a significant impact
on user satisfaction.

### Routine Review and
Adjustment

- Establish a process for routine review of the feedback collection and analysis system itself, ensuring that it remains effective in
capturing and categorizing user insights.
- Adjust the feedback mechanism as needed to ensure it encourages maximum user participation and captures high-quality, actionable
feedback. Correctness , consistency. ### Protocols for Evaluation and Logging
