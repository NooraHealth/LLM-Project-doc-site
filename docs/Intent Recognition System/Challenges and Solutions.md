**Challenges and Solutions**

- Mitigation strategies

### Challenges

- Inaccurate classification of a message -> Label and assign all

- Inaccurate translation leading to wrong medical answers -> MSEs
will flag this and provide a feedback
- Evaluation gets into an infinite regress: How do we evaluate the evaluation?
