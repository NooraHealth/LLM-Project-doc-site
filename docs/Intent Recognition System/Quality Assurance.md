# Quality Assurance

### Protocols for Intent Recognition

### Human classified dataset
preparation

- Collect a varied set of messages across different intents and languages.
- Review and validate the classifications to resolve discrepancies and refine the quality of the dataset. -> Engineering team would do a
first pass. -200 per classfication per language

### Comparison with System
Output

- Compare automated classifications with the human-classified dataset to identify mismatches.
- Conduct error analysis to categorize and understand the nature of misclassifications, focusing on specific areas for improvement.
- Integrate feedback by using insights from the comparison to refine
and retrain the model, enhancing its accuracy.

### Gradual Release Strategy

- Start with a pilot release to a limited audience or controlled environment to test the systemâ€™s performance in real-world
scenarios.
- Monitor performance and scale gradually, increasing the user base and load incrementally while continuously integrating user feedback and
system performance data.
- Iterate based on feedback, updating the training dataset with new examples and refining the model to improve accuracy and
reliability.

### Continuous Improvement

- Collect and classify new data regularly to keep the dataset current and representative.
- Implement adaptive learning techniques, if feasible, to allow the model to learn from ongoing interactions.
- Expand deployment cautiously as the system demonstrates increased accuracy and reliability, always monitoring for new opportunities to
enhance performance.
