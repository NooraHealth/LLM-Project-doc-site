Intent Recognition: Turn stacks/Journey to trigger custom webhook hosting the LLM Chat Bot Application that does classification.

### System Components

##### Message Reception and Pre-processing

Ingestion API: Utilize Python's Fast API framework to create RESTful APIs that efficiently handle incoming messages from turn’s webhook (or Meta’s cloud business manager.)

Pre-processing Service: Implement a service to sanitize and standardize messages by removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and other necessary pre processing steps to ensure data quality for NLP/LLM analysis.

##### NLP and Machine Learning for Intent Classification:      

Method 1: Easy and Fast Dev Time but a bit Expensive:

GPT-4 Classification: Leverage GPT-4 for direct message classification, bypassing the need for a separate translation layer, suitable for straightforward intent recognition tasks.More Dev time but cheaper and less accurate:

Method 2:  Translation services and NLP Libraries: For multilingual support, integrate ai4bharat’s transliteration and translation services followed by TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning. Use NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy for additional text processing and classification into predefined intent categories.

Model Training: Employ supervised learning techniques with a well-labeled dataset containing diverse examples of user messages mapped to target intent categories.

Model Deployment: Package and deploy the trained model as a microservice, utilizing Docker for enhanced scalability, portability, and isolation.

##### Action Handlers

Function Dispatcher: A crucial system component responsible for mapping classified intents to corresponding action handlers, including integration with GPT-4 Functions for dynamic response generation.

Handlers: Develop specific handlers for common intents such as greetings, feedback, acknowledgments, marking spam, and managing user language preferences. Ensure handlers update the user's status or preferences in a unified database for consistent communication.

Types: Greetings, Acknowledgments ,Spam, Requests to change language, Medical Questions

##### Suggested FAQ:

Semantic based gpt4 retrieval to provide user with suggested FAQ and its answers while the users wait for a medical response.

##### Technical Stack and Tools

Backend and APIs: Build the backend infrastructure using Python, leveraging Fast API for its asynchronous support and ease of use in creating RESTful services.
NLP/ML Components: Utilize GPT-4 for intent classification, TensorFlow or PyTorch for building custom ML models, and NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy for text analysis and preprocessing.
Database Management: Implement SQL Alchemy for structured data storage and intent categorization records. Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data or responses to enhance system performance.
Suggested FAQ: Whatsapp templates with buttons/list.

##### Caveats

When classifying messages received through webhooks, it's important to note that this approach may overlook the broader context of conversations. Specifically, accurate message classification often necessitates access to the chat history, as some inputs can only be properly understood and classified within their conversational context. 

Therefore, after establishing a foundational message classification system, it's advisable to enhance its accuracy by incorporating the user's chat history into the classification process. This integration will allow for a more nuanced understanding of the messages, leading to improved classification outcomes.
