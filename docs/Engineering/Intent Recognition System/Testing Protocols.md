### Protocols for Intent Recognition

#### Human classified dataset preparation
- Collect a varied set of messages across different intents and languages.
- Review and validate the classifications to resolve discrepancies and refine the quality of the dataset. -> Engineering team would do a first pass. -200 per classfication per language

#### Comparison with System Output
- Compare automated classifications with the human-classified dataset to identify mismatches.
- Conduct error analysis to categorize and understand the nature of misclassifications, focusing on specific areas for improvement.
- Integrate feedback by using insights from the comparison to refine and retrain the model, enhancing its accuracy.

#### Gradual Release Strategy
- Start with a pilot release to a limited audience or controlled environment to test the system's performance in real-world scenarios.
- Monitor performance and scale gradually, increasing the user base and load incrementally while continuously integrating user feedback and system performance data.
- Iterate based on feedback, updating the training dataset with new examples and refining the model to improve accuracy and reliability.

#### Continuous Improvement
- Collect and classify new data regularly to keep the dataset current and representative.
- Implement adaptive learning techniques, if feasible, to allow the model to learn from ongoing interactions.
- Expand deployment cautiously as the system demonstrates increased accuracy and reliability, always monitoring for new opportunities to enhance performance.


### Protocols for Testers
- Engage a diverse group of testers, including those fluent in the system's supported languages and individuals with healthcare knowledge, to manually input queries and evaluate the system's responses for accuracy, relevance, and usefulness.
- Testers should also assess the user interface's usability, particularly the effectiveness and accessibility of the feedback mechanisms.
### Protocols for Feedback Collection
- For each query response provided by the MSE Assistant, include a "thumbs up" (satisfied) or "thumbs down" (dissatisfied) option, allowing users to quickly express their satisfaction level with the response.
- Alongside the satisfaction indicator, provide an optional input field where users can elaborate on their feedback, offering insights into what they found helpful or areas where the response fell short. This input field can capture valuable details on the user's experience, expectations, and specific issues encountered.

### Protocols for Iterative Improvement

#### Analysis of Feedback
- Regularly analyze the feedback, categorizing it based on the type of query, the nature of the feedback (positive or negative), and any specific suggestions or issues highlighted by users.
- Pay particular attention to repeated patterns of dissatisfaction or specific areas where users consistently request improvements.

#### System Refinement
- Utilize the feedback to make targeted improvements to the MSE Assistant. This could involve enhancing the translation layer for better accuracy, updating the medical FAQ bank to address gaps in information, or refining the response generation process for greater relevance and clarity.
- Prioritize updates based on the frequency and severity of the feedback, ensuring that changes are likely to have a significant impact on user satisfaction.

#### Routine Review and Adjustment
- Establish a process for routine review of the feedback collection and analysis system itself, ensuring that it remains effective in capturing and categorizing user insights.
- Adjust the feedback mechanism as needed to ensure it encourages maximum user participation and captures high-quality, actionable feedback. Correctness , consistency.
