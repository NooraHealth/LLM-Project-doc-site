### Data Management procedures

This document outlines the data management practices for training the machine learning models. All of these practices have been taken from the literature and the sources have been cited along with them.

MLOps softwares we could use:

- MLflow
- Weights and Biases

The MLflow seems to be a better software for ML model management whereas we should be careful about the data management as well which we can maintain using the data version controlling software.
