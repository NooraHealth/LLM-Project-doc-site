### Current User Journey

Image (to be added) on the top level overview of the journey
(assignment, categorisation, ticket creation, FAQ bank search,
translation)

### FAQ Bank Search

Action: Before escalating the query, the MSE searches the FAQ bank to
check if there is already an answer to the user’s question. This step is
crucial for efficient query resolution and minimizing doctor involvement
for frequently asked questions.

- Outcome: If an answer is found, it’s prepared to be sent to the
  user. If not, the MSE proceeds to the next step.
- Tools/Systems Used: Internal FAQ bank or knowledge base.

### Translation

and Escalation for Unanswered Questions

- Action (if the FAQ does not contain an answer):
- Translation Request: The MSE raises a request to translate the query
  into a language that the doctor can understand.
- Doctor Escalation: Once translated, the query is escalated to a
  doctor for a professional medical response.
- Waiting for Response: The MSE waits for the doctor’s response,
  monitoring the ticket status.

Translation of Doctor’s Response: Upon receiving a response, the MSE
raises another request to translate the doctor’s response back into the
user’s language.

Outcome: The translated response is sent back to the user, resolving
their query.

Tools/Systems Used: Translation services, doctor communication
portal, and the ticketing system for tracking.
