### MSE Assistant:
Efficient Medical Query Resolution:

Rapid Response Mechanism: Ensure swift and effective resolution of
user medical queries.

Accelerated Translation Process:Ensure prompt and accurate
translations for both user queries and generated responses. (Achieved
through language-based routing system, which assigns queries to Medical
Support Executives (MSEs) who are proficient in the relevant languages,
thereby guaranteeing a seamless and efficient communication flow.)

### Enhancing
User Experience by Minimizing Waiting Times:

- To improve the efficiency and user satisfaction during periods of
wait, implement a feature that automatically presents users with a
curated list of frequently asked questions and their corresponding
answers relevant to their medical inquiries.
- This proactive approach aims to provide immediate assistance and
potentially resolve queries even before a response is received from the
Medical Support Expert (MSE).If that answered their query, They can
close the chat with a button if that answered their query.
