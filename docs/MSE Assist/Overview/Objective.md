# Objective

As we expand our reach to provide health responses for patient caregivers across geographies, the ability for MSEs (Medical Support Executives) to reply to our caregivers efficiently without compromising on quality becomes a challenge. The AI copilot assists the MSE to perform a 4C (Consistent, Complete, Contextual and Correct) review on every response as follows: 

#### Consistency
The responses need to have a consistent tone and voice. It should always aid the user in taking positive health actions.

####  Completeness
The responses should ensure that all observations are taken into account while providing the responses (patient history, earlier queries resolved, condition area, level of risk)

#### Contextual
The responses should be adapted to the local context and utilised multi-lingual semantic matching to translate accurately

#### Correct
The responses are medically accurate by digesting the FAQ bank through semantic search and surfacing the most relevant responses

In this way, we elevate the support quality, minimise the wait-time and reduce the reliance for direct support.
